# ðŸ§¾ Week 4 Task â€“ CMOS Circuit Design *(sky130-style)*
---

### ðŸ“Œ Why This Task Matters

This task deepens the understanding of how **transistor-level circuit properties** â€” such as **device physics**, **transistor sizing**, and **process variation** â€” drive the **timing behavior** that **Static Timing Analysis (STA)** evaluates.

By working through **CMOS design** and **SPICE simulations**, one can explore the **real transistor-level effects** that STA approximates.

This hands-on experience will help:

* Build **strong intuition** about how **slack** and **delay** are affected by device-level characteristics.
* Understand **noise margins** and their practical implications.
* Appreciate how **process variation** impacts circuit performance.
