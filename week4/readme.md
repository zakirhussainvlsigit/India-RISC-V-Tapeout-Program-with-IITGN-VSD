## ðŸ§¾ Week 4 Task â€“ CMOS Circuit Design *(sky130-style)*

### ðŸ“Œ Why This Task Matters *(Revised)*

This task deepens your understanding of how **transistor-level circuit properties** â€” such as **device physics**, **transistor sizing**, and **process variation** â€” drive the **timing behavior** that **Static Timing Analysis (STA)** evaluates.

By working through **CMOS design** and **SPICE simulations** *(as done in the sky130 workshop)*, you will explore the **real transistor-level effects** that STA approximates.

This hands-on experience will help you:

* ðŸ”¸ Build **strong intuition** about how **slack** and **delay** are affected by device-level characteristics.
* ðŸ”¸ Understand **noise margins** and their practical implications.
* ðŸ”¸ Appreciate how **process variation** impacts circuit performance.
