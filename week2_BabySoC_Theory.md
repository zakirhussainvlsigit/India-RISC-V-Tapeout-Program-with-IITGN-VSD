## Week 2 Task – BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling

### Objective
To build a solid understanding of **SoC fundamentals** and practice **functional modelling** of  
the **BabySoC** using simulation tools (**Icarus Verilog** & **GTKWave**).

---

## Part 1 – Theory (Conceptual Understanding)

### Theory Reference
[Fundamentals of SoC Design Notes](https://github.com/hemanthkumardm/SFAL-VSD-SoC-Journey/tree/main/11.%20Fundamentals%20of%20SoC%20Design)

### Focus Areas
- **What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?**  
- **Components of a typical SoC** (CPU, memory, peripherals, interconnect)  
- **Why BabySoC** is a simplified model for learning SoC concepts  
- **The role of functional modelling** before RTL and physical design stages  

---

## Deliverable
- A **1–2 page write-up** on GitHub summarizing your understanding of SoC design fundamentals  
- Explanation of how **BabySoC** fits into this learning journey  

## Check the following for Deliverables
