# Week 2 Task – BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling

### Objective
- To build a solid understanding of SoC fundamentals and practice functional modelling of the BabySoC using simulation tools (Icarus Verilog & GTKWave).

- Part 1 – Theory (Conceptual Understanding)
   - Go through the Fundamentals of SoC Design notes:
       - Theory Reference:- https://github.com/hemanthkumardm/SFAL-VSD-SoC-Journey/tree/main/11.%20Fundamentals%20of%20SoC%20Design  
            - Focus on:
               - What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?
               - Components of a typical SoC (CPU, memory, peripherals, interconnect).
               - Why BabySoC is a simplified model for learning SoC concepts.
               - The role of functional modelling before RTL and physical design stages.
