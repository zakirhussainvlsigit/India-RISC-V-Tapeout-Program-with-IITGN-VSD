# Labs on GLS and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch

- GLS stands for Gate Level Simulation  

- Todo the gate level simulation we need the following 3 files  
   1. verilog model files of the standard cell library
   2. netlist file  
   3. testbench file  


- Lab GLS Synth Sim Mismatch part1
   - The following are the files for this lab

   - Consider mux2x1 using ternary operator
      - iverilog for comiling : After compilation we will get a.out file
      - execute the a.out in the terminal ./a.out, this will generate the .vcd file
      - See that as shown in the below figure
